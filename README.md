# Google-Review-Analysis

> This project aims to find out what customers care more about when choosing a restaurant. My big data analysis team and I collected nearly 10 million reviews on Google Maps, tokenized those reviews, and visualized results using a static HTML page.

## General Information
- Intro 

  Nowadays, people are increasingly relying on online reviews to decide on restaurants, products, hotels, etc. Therefore, a thought raced to my mind that analyzing customers’ reviews might help businesses get some insights and improve their revenue. And, as we know, bread is the staff of life. So, I decided to analyze every restaurant review on Google Maps with my big data analysis team to see what points customers care about more.

- Purposes

  1. Find out customer preference based on each city and restaurant type.
  2. Relationship between specific customers and restaurants.
  3. Analyze the trend of the number of reviews and provide market strategies.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- pySpark
- Hadoop Cluster
- HTML
- D3.js
- Tableau

## Room for Improvement

1. We can only collect user names, some of which are the same, on Google Maps now. If we can get unique customer information, like user ID, in the future, we can provide more correct results.

2. If we have enough time, we can extract specialties in each restaurant and recommend to customers what to order.

3. Looking deeply into how dining styles changed recently might offer much more precise recommendations for restaurant advertising strategy.
